Final Project Coursework for SNHU Master of Science in IT/Software Development - IT-650 Principles of Database Design.

## Features
This project contains a detailed and careful review of the current state of a database design, impacted stakeholders, and the database and software requirements necessary for current and long-term success. After this evaluation, a relational database management system (RDBMS) is proposed.  
> The case study selected was for the fictitious Wild Wood Apartments complex and their current software design (see link below for actual case study notes).

## Technologies/Programming utilized
- Microsoft Visio
- Microsoft SQL Server

## Intention of this Program
- Construct and refine conceptual and logical models that include the necessary entities, relationships,

environments to align to organizational needs
- Develop enterprise database management system models that accurately reflect fundamental
organizational operating rules
- Create physical designs that account for organizational application, hardware, network, operating system,
and data communications requirements
- Determine best practices for ensuring ethical and legal compliance for data usage and storage based on
established industry-wide information technology standards and regulations
